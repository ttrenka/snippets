# Classic ASP/JScript
Because of some project requirements, I was forced to use Classic ASP at times (even though the
technology was way out of date). Because of this, I've saved some of my work here. Explanations
follow.

## crawlr
`crawlr` is an older utility + content management system originally written in 2003 or so. The
core library simplifies a number of server-side operations, such as database access, JSON parse/serialize,
file system access, internet access, emailing and more. See the README file under the `crawlr` folder
for more information.

## Miscellaneous
This folder is a placeholder for one-off types of Classic ASP scripts. Currently, there is only
a LESS parser meant to run as part of a web service; more may be added in the future.
