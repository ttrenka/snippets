# CSharp libraries
This folder contains a number of C#-based projects written for various projects over the
years.

## SiteUtils
This is a small utility library I wrote that handles some very basic aspects of a SaaS/ReST-like API
application. I combined some techniques I've been building over the years to make some basic but verbose
operations very easy to use, with a lot of flexibility built in.

For information on each class within the project, check the README in the `/SiteUtils` folder.

## DepartmentZed
This is a set of libraries/functionality originally written for a full-featured e-commerce site. It
includes classes to manage online transactions (Authorize.NET), FTP operations, an older version of
the Amazon Merchant API, checks against a 3rd party fulfillment system, and a lot more.
