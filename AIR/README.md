#Queued
Back when Adobe was pushing AIR (thier Flash-based desktop developer API), we (SitePen) were asked
to make a demo for them that demonstrated the following:

* Integrate the Dojo Toolkit (1.x) into the AIR enviroment
* Use the Netflix API to manage a user's Netflix Queue
* Set up OAuth (v1) to access the Netflix APIs
* Use of the internal data storage of AIR
* Ability to work both online and offline (Network availablity detection)

Fortunately, Adobe asked us to open-source the codebase (no longer available as far as I can tell; we'd
hosted it on the now-defunct Google Code), so I can talk about it without fear of legal reprisal ;) Also
fortunately, most of the teammates on the project wrote a series of blog posts about the whole process:
