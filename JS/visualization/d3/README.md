# d3.js Visualizations
Various examples of custom visualizations live in this project.

in the future._

This visualization is an implementation of a Bollinger band-type of visualization, with a baseline (the raw data), a
moving average, and high/low Bollinger bands. Originally written as a way of detecting some kind of anomaly (in the
original, a number of phone calls out of an expected range based on historical data), it is useful for stock charts
and other situations where some kind of standard deviation analysis is needed.
