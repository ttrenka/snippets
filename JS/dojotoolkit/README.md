# The Dojo Toolkit
I was one of the first major contributors to the Dojo Toolkit lines 0.x/1.x; I will not include
the entire toolkit here, but the various modules I either wrote outright, or in collaboration with
one or two other people.

The majority of this work was placed in the DojoX sub-project, of which I was project lead/BDFL for
3 or so years.

Some of these sub-projects have actual working tests (usually located in the `/tests` subdirectory;
they will not work from this repository but you can go here:

https://downloads.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.6.5/dojo-release-1.6.5/dojox/

...where they will run. Note that this site will give you a "Not Secure" message (it is considered
legacy); it is simply a set of directory listings and is safe to browse.
