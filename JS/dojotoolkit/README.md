# The Dojo Toolkit
I was one of the first major contributors to the Dojo Toolkit lines 0.x/1.x; I will not include
the entire toolkit here, but the various modules I either wrote outright, or in collaboration with
one or two other people.

The majority of this work was placed in the DojoX sub-project, of which I was project lead/BDFL for
3 or so years.
