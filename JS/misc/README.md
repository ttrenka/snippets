# Miscellaneous (`/misc`)
In this folder will be various "black-box" files, random pieces of code written for older projects that were one-offs.
Details below.

## QuickParser
This is a module designed to replicate the entire functionality of Google Calendar's Quick Event Entry input. It will
parse the natural English into an iCal-like object that can be used/tranformed into any other Cal format needed (this
particular project had some custom types, so going directly to the iCal spec wasn't an option).
