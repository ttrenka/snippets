# snippets
Over the years, I've kept my hands on some of the best examples of work I can think of as reference implementations. This
repository is my official GitHub "place" to store them, since I'm pretty tired of trying to find code on any number of
extermal hard drives/backup drives.

Some of these are open-source (or were; for instance, Queued had been open-sourced but stored on the now defunct Google Code)
and some were written for specfic client projects. Due to ambiguous legal issues, I have done my best to scrub any reference
to a client.

At one point all of this code worked very well but for the most part, it needs to be run "in context", and in some cases are
based on outdated versions (for instance, the `/PHP/JSON-RPC` section was based on PHP 5.x).

Where I've been able to, I've included either screenshots or short demonstration videos in the README files. To view, navigate
to the project/sub-project in question.

Again, I will refer to a good portion of this code when working on new projects that seem relevant. For example, if I am
tasked with creating an e-commerce application in C#, I will refer to the `/CS/DepartmentZed/` project(s); for PHP, the
`/PHP/ecomm/` one.
